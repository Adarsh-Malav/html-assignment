        <h2>Canvas and SVG tags</h2>
        <p>The primary distinction between the two is that SVG uses geometric shapes to render graphics, whereas Canvas uses pixels. This means that SVG graphics are resolution-independent,
            which means they can be resized without losing quality, 
            whereas Canvas graphics become blurry and distorted when resized</p>
